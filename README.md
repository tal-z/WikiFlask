# WikiTools
Webapp tools for building Wikipedia literacy. Built with Flask, and styled according to the template for my personal website.

## Tools:
- <b>PlotWikiRevisions:</b> A widget to plot the revisions to a given Wikipedia page over time.
- <b>PlotWikiEditors:</b> A widget to view the top ten editors by frequency for a given Wikipedia page over time.
